00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.200
I wish I found some better
sounds no one's ever heard

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.000
I wish I had a better voice
that sang some better words

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.850
I wish I found some chords in
an order that is new

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.650
I wish I didn't have to rhyme
every time I sang

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.250
I was told when I get older
all my fears would shrink

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.650
But now I'm insecure and I
care what people think

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.840
My name's Blurryface and I
care what you think

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.250
My name's Blurryface and I
care what you think

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.650
Wish we could turn back time,
to the good old days

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.800
When our momma sang us to
sleep but now we're stressed
out

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:58.740
Wish we could turn back time,
to the good old days

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.000
When our momma sang us to
sleep but now we're stressed
out

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.650
We're stressed out
